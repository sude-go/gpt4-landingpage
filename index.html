        GPT-4 is the latest iteration of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT), a powerful language model created by OpenAI. It is designed with improved performance compared to its predecessors and is engineered to be more aligned with human values. GPT-4 will have "multimodal models" that allow for more types of content generation, such as video. GPT-4 has the potential to revolutionize how companies create and distribute content, and can be used to generate product descriptions, social media posts, and email campaigns. It is being trained on a massive amount of data and will be able to generate human-like text for multiple tasks.

        <div class="feature" id="future-2">
        In terms of problem-solving abilities, GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge. It is more creative and collaborative than ever before. It can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user's writing style. GPT-4 surpasses ChatGPT in its advanced reasoning capabilities.
        </div>
        <div class="feature" id="future-3">
          GPT-4 is more advanced in three key areas: creativity, visual input, and longer context. In terms of creativity, OpenAI says GPT-4 is much better at both creating and collaborating with users on creative projects. GPT-4 can accept a prompt of text and images which lets the user specify any vision or language task. Specifically, it generates text outputs (natural language, code, etc.) given inputs consisting of interspersed text and images.
